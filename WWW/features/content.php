			I guess you're wondering what kind of things you'll be able to do on FMN? Plenty! Take a look below at some of FMN's features:
			<ul class="logo">
				<li>
					<h2>Customisable tasks</h2>
					<p>
						From their creation to their completion, their description and details, control it all on FMN! The tasks end with you!
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Categorise your tasks</h2>
					<p>
						Add a task to a list (or lists!) of things-to-do and then share it with your friends and colleagues, so you can get everyone organised!
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>List permissions</h2>
					<p>
					 Need to make a list that people can view, but they can't change? It's easy with FMN's List Permissions system!
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Automated Email Reminders</h2>
					<p>
						Yep, we too are looking forward to flooding your emails with more spam (but we really hope that you use our website instead).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Offline Storage</h2>
					<p>
						Can't actually get to FMN at a point in time? Never fear! You can use our handy Local Synch feature to get a copy of your to-do list and store it on your computer.
