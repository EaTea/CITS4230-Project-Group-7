		I guess you're wondering what kind of things you'll be able to do on XYZ? Plenty! Take a look below at some of XYZ's features:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Customisable tasks, from their creation to their completion and details
			</li>
			<li>
				Categorise your tasks: add a task to a list (or lists!) of things-to-do and then share it with your friends and colleagues
			</li>
			<li>
				List permissions: need to make a list that people can view, but they can't change? It's easy with XYZ's List Permissions system
			</li>
			<li>
				Automated Email Reminders: yep, we too are looking forward to flooding your emails with more spam (but we really hope that you use our website instead)
			</li>
			<li>
				Offline Storage: Can't actually get to XYZ at a point in time? Never fear! You can use our handy Local Synch feature to get a copy of your To-Do List and store it on your computer
			</li>
		</ul>
