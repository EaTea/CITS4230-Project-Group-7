		<ul class="styledList">
			<li>
				<h3 class="itemTitle">Customisable tasks</h3>
				<p>
					From their creation to their completion, their description and details, control it all on FMN! The tasks end with you!
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 class="itemTitle">Categorise your tasks</h3>
				<p>
					Add a task to a list (or lists!) of things-to-do and then share it with your friends and colleagues, so you can get everyone organised!
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 class="itemTitle">List permissions</h3>
				<p>
				 Need to make a list that people can view, but they can't change? It's easy with FMN's List Permissions system!
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 class="itemTitle">Automated Email Reminders</h3>
				<p>
					Yep, we too are looking forward to flooding your emails with more spam (but we really hope that you use our website instead).
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 class="itemTitle">Offline Storage</h3>
				<p>
					Can't actually get to FMN at a point in time? Never fear! You can use our handy Local Synch feature to get a copy of your to-do list and store it on your computer.
