A CITS4230 Project at UWA:
Build a database driven web application using Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS and ECMAScript.

Helper scripts included in this repo:

./upload
Syncs the contents of a local "WWW" directory to a sub-directory of your
CSSE student WWW directory.
Variables:
  CLEAR - Set this to 1 to delete extraneous files from destination dirs.
  ID - Set this to pass your student ID.
  SUBDIR - Set this to change the sub-directory.
Example usage:
  CLEAR=1 ID=12345678 ./upload

./rails-local
Starts up a rails server on the local machine.
Variables:
  PORT - Set this value to change the port to use from 3000
Example usage:
  ./rails-local

./rails-remote
Syncs the contents of a local "todo" directory to the group server.
Variables:
  TMPDIR - Set this to change the tmp directory used on your remote account.
  ID - Set this to pass your student ID.
Example usage:
  ID=12345678 ./rails-remote

./group-upload
Uploads the whole project up to the group server.
This calls ./upload and ./rails-remote so the variables are the same.
