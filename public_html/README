Form Controls:
 - Used in:
    - Log In form in the header
	   - Takes in user details for verification.
	- Registration form
	   - Takes in user details for account creation.

CSS:
 - Used in:
    - Global level external CSS is used on all pages
	   - Used to style all the common elements on each page, especially the header and footer parts.
	- Embeded CSS is not used, but is simulated with local level externals - used on nearly all pages
	   - Used to style multiple elements specific to that page.
	- Inline CSS shouldn't be used in the markup to avoid mixing presentation, but is used within our scripts.
	   - Used to style the slideshow on the home page.

Client-side Programming:
 - Javascript was used.
 - Used in:
    - Slideshow
	   - Accesses the DOM to create the widget nodes,
	   - Applies and removes inline styles to make transitions in the slideshow.
	     - Inline style editing allows overriding of all other styles.
	   - Uses DOM2 events.
	     - Register events onto my widgets, as well as the document root node.
	       - Registering at the root node allows me to detect when an event occurs outside the slideshow area. This is used to detect when mouse focus is on or taken off (ie. hover state)
	- Form validation
	   - Used to validate forms when HTML5 validation is not available - when available, both will be done.

Server-side Programming:
 - PHP was used.
 - Used in:
    - All pages
	   - To extend portability and reference URLs no matter how deep or shallow the site was going to be.
	   - Increase modularity to reduce the amount of duplicated code.
	   
Web pages have been tested with Firefox 7.0 and partially tested on Opera 10.50.
Some features were unsupported in this old version of Opera, so a few declarations were dropped.
Firefox 7.0 reports 2 warnings:
 - Unknown property 'target-name'.  Declaration dropped.
   - This is covered with a fallback ECMAScript function, which emulates it.
 - Unknown property 'transition'.  Declaration dropped.
   - The vendor extension -moz-transition is detected, so it works.

Other requirements:
 - Currently only works correctly with screens width >=960px
   - Work may be done later to allow better resizing
 - Email is obfuscated and requires ECMAScript. Also, reference to Project Honey Pot was made to hopefully repel spambots - although, we don't have a terms of use with it.

**NOTE:** This does not work with IE at the moment as we are using DOM2 events.
It is currently higher priority for us to get some backwards compatibility with fallback script emulations for HTML5 and CSS3 features, which are still very new and not very well supported.

W3C's Style Validation errors:
global/style.css:
Line 109:
	0 is not a box-shadow value : 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)
	Reason: Seems to pass if I put inset on, which is just an extra optional argument: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-box-shadow so it should be valid without it. Probably a bug in the validator.
Line 194:
	Value Error : text-shadow Too many values or values are not recognized : 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)
	Reason: I couldn't find a clear explanation from the W3 specifications, but I used the syntax shown on w3schools.com and it rendered correctly with no warning or errors logged in Firefox. Probably a bug in the validator.
Line 229:
	Same as 109.
Line 258:
	Property transition doesn't exist : background 100ms linear background 100ms linear
	Reason: The transition property is valid, and at working draft: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/
Line 279:
	Value Error : border-left Too many values or values are not recognized : 1px solid rgba(100%,100%,100%,0.3) 1px solid rgba(100%,100%,100%,0.3)
	Reason: It doesn't seem to like the alpha value in the border. It works in Firefox and it is a valid colour. Probably a bug in the validator.
Line 307, 317, 327:
	Sorry, the at-rule @keyframes is not implemented.
	Reason: Self explanatory.
Line 338:
	Property animation doesn't exist : glow 800ms ease 0 infinite alternate glow 800ms ease 0 infinite alternate
	Reason: The animation property is valid, and at working draft: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/
Line 343:
	Same as 109.
Line 387:
	Property target-name doesn't exist : new new
	Reason: The target-* properties are valid, and at working draft: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-hyperlinks/#the-target-name

style.css:
Line 51:
	Same as 258 in global/style.css
Line 67:
	10% is not a border-radius value : 10% 10% 
	Reason: Should be valid according to http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-border-radius so it is probably a bug in the validator.
Line 71:
	Same as 258 in global/style.css
